# FastPass
Local password manager

I created personal password manager.

How to run:
Download sourcecode and run it. On first run the app will create its own database.

Current functionality:
Saving passwords for a website including savetime.
Creating a random password (Length = 16 characters)

Note: This app is not yet secure - Passwords are still saved in plaintext.

TODO:
Finish "Copy to clipboard" functionality.
Encrypt passwords before saving.
